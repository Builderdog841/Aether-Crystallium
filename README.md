# Biomes
There are 3 new main biomes that wait to be explored:

## The Elevated Islands
A region known for its unique geography and resources. The Coasts are made-up by a block called Gravity Gravel that increases your Jump Height when stepped. The grass is rather pale and trees come in a mixture of blues and gold. In ancient times this place has been used for rituals because of its location.

## The Wyndcaps
The Wyndcaps is the coldest region of the Aether. Only a select few creatures like the Highland Buffalo were able to survive its unforgiving temperatures. New Vegetation was able to form through that, covering the area with frozen taigas. A long time ago Valkyries experimented in now abandoned labs here.

## The Sakura Jungle
A region full of lushious flora and exciting terrain. It is home to the vibrant Sakura Trees and new wildlife. These jungles exist due to the higher concentration of Ambrosium these islands have. But don't let this trick you since Ancient Forces are always watching.
