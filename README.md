## What does this Add-On add?
The main goal of Ancient Aether to make the Aether feel more adventurous with a 1.18 Styled World Generation, New Biomes, Structures, Mobs, Blocks, Dungeons and a lot more.

## New World Generation
The Aether now has Mountains, Larger Islands, Caves, Big Cliffs, Quicksoil Coasts and more. The Ore Spawnrate has also been adjusted to fit these changes:

- Ambrosium and Icestone can now be found below y256
- Zanite can now be found below y160
- Gravitite can now be found below y64 and more frequently below y96
- There is also rare chance to find Gravitite above y180 now

These World Generation Changes can easily be disabled as they are an in-built Datapack.

I also took some time to give the Default Aether Biomes a little make-over with a new Wood Type, Caves and more. You can easily disable those changes via Datapack.

## Biomes
Ancient Aether adds 10 new Biomes that should provide a lot of exploration and fun 

### The Mythical Forests:

These Biomes are rather common to the Aether and are mostly made up by Forested Areas with some Clearings scattered in between. The Grass is very pale while the leaves have a blueish color giving the biome a very magical vibe. Especially because its coasts are made up by a new Block called Divine Gravel. The Region doesn't have all its content implemented yet but will in the following updates.



### The Wyndcaps:
The Wyndcaps are a very cold region of the Aether. It is made up by 4 biomes:

- Wyndcap Taiga
- Festive Wyndcap Taiga
- Wyndcap Highland
- Wyndcap Peaks

These biomes have new flora and fauna like the Sky Blues, Wynd Thistle and are also the home of the Highland Buffalo, the mascot of the Mod.



### The Sakura Jungle:
A rare Biome that is native to the beautiful Sakura Trees that come
with their own Wood Type. Aswell as new Vegetation and Mobs like the Roothyrns.

The Underground of this Biome is mostly made-up by the Overgrown Caverns Biome which has double the amount of Ambrosium Ore as other biomes. This biome has a Variant called Skyroot Jungle that acts as an indicator that a Sakura Jungle is near.


### Crystal Hollows:

A rare Cave Biome that generates in the Underground of the Aether's Islands. Inside of it you will now find Crystal Trees, which have been overhauled, instead of generating on small islands in the sky. Though like with the Mythical Forests, there is more to come with this biome.


## Structures
This mod currently has 3 Structures to offer, that should give you more reasons to explore this Hostile Paradise:

### Valkyrie Settlements
Found in Skyroot Meadows and Groves, although currently uninhabited, these will be the home of Valkyrie Traders in the future

### Sentry Laboratory
These mysterious Structures can rarely be found in the depths of the Wyndcaps Region. The main reward these abandoned Laboratorys have to offer is the Ancient Rune. This item acts as the key to the dangerous Ancient Dungeon. This isn't the only trrasure this Structure has to offer.

### Ancient Dungeon
You might stumble upon its entrance if you explore the Sakura Jungle. This dungeon is a huge underground Labyrinth with new unique loot like Sakura Moa Eggs, the Aethers best Moa. This dungeon isn't quite finished yet and its current mob, Leaping Sentry is just a placeholder. There is also going to be a brand new boss in the future that is actively being worked on.
 

These structures are all still very early in development and will be altered drastically in the near future.
